## Installation

To install the package, run:

```bash
composer require gaza/validation-generator
```

---

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the provided artisan command to generate validation rules for any table in your database.

### Command

```bash
php artisan validate-table {tableName}
```

Replace `{tableName}` with the name of the table you want to validate.

### Example

For a table named `users` with the following schema:

| Column      | Type       | Nullable | Length | Extra           |
|-------------|------------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| id          | BIGINT     | NO       | -      | Auto Increment  |
| name        | VARCHAR    | NO       | 255    |                 |
| email       | VARCHAR    | YES      | 255    |                 |
| phone       | VARCHAR    | NO       | 255    |                 |
| note        | TEXT       | YES      | -      |                 |
| created_at  | TIMESTAMP  | YES      | -      |                 |
| updated_at  | TIMESTAMP  | YES      | -      |                 |

Running the command:

```bash
php artisan validate-table users
```

Will output:

```php
[
    'name' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
    'email' => ['nullable', 'string', 'max:255'],
    'phone' => ['required', 'string', 'max:255'],
    'note' => ['nullable', 'string'],
]
```
